# Recipe Puppy iOS
This simple iOS apps allows the user to search through the recipes from [recipepuppy.com](recipepuppy.com), filtering them by ingredients (keywords).

The results are displayed in a `UITableView` which is instantly populated as the user types in. 

This is mainly an exercise to show the use of **MVVM** pattern combined with `RxSwift`.

The goal is to achieve a better separation between data model, presentation and business logic as well as improving general testability.

The app is written in `Swift 4` and uses the `Codable` protocol.
